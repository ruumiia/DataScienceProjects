<h1> Basic Data Exploration </h1>

<h2> Fire Case Reports </h2>

<h3> Business Problem / Problem Domain </h3>

The given data are records of fire cases reported in months of January, February, March, and April from year 2002 until 2009. 
It also includes the temperature recorded from each month when cases occurred and places where fire cases are happen.

<i>Strictly change the column names of the given data set.  Use “Year” for 0, “Month” for 1, “Temperature” for 2, “Place” for 3, and “Number” for 4.</i>

<hr>

Answer the following questions through EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

<ul>
    <li>Which place has the most numerous cases of fire in general?</li>
    <li>What is the average temperature in Winchester when number of cases is higher than 2?</li>
    <li>What is the maximum temperature during January?</li>
    <li>Which year/s has/have the most number of cases?</li>
    <li>Which month has the least number of cases?</li>
    <li>Which place has the greatest number of cases during April?</li>
    <li>What is the least temperature during February of 2002 to 2004?</li>
    <li>Which place has the least temperature from 2008 to 2009?</li>
    <li>What is the highest temperature from 2003 to 2007?</li>
    <li>Which place has the least case of fire?</li>
