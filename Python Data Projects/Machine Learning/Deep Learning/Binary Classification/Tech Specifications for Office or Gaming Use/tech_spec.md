<h2> Background </h2>

You are provided computer specifications comprising of 7 columns with 50 records: (1) the Item No. of the computer, (2) the CPU, (3) the RAM, (4) Type of Storage Used, (5) the Storage Capacity, (6) the GPU, and (7) the Target Usage of the computer. 

Answer the following questions through exploratory data analysis.

1. What CPU is mostly used in Gaming? 

2. How much gigabyte of RAM is usually used by gamers?

3. What CPU is mostly used in Office works?

4. Provide an additional analysis or question to answer.

Clean and explore the dataset, analysis and conclusions must be supported with data visualizations, then prepare the data to be suitable for creating deep learning model. 

Create a deep learning model with dense layers that will identify whether the specific specs are for gaming or for office.
