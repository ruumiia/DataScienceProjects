<h1 id="fire-case"> Grades Analysis </h1>

<h2> Business Problem / Problem Domain </h2>

The given data are recorded grades of students from different subjects such as Physics, Mathematics, English and Literature.

Questions:

1. Which subject do students excel the most? Support your answer with analysis and explanation.

2. How many students are below 87 in both Math and Physics?

        (For example student A got 83 in Math and 86 in Physics, this is counted because they are both below 87. If student B got 87 in Math and 83 in Physics, don't include.)

3. What is/are the grade/s of the student/s in math who got the highest grade/s in Physics?

4. What is/are the grade/s of the student/s in English who got the lowest grade/s in Math?

5. How can you describe the relationship between Math and English?
