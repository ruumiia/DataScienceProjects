<h3> Abstract </h3>

>The thesis focuses on the development and implementation of a
Rule-based AI Chatbot that emphasizes on improving online help support in the MyDCampus site. The system development process followed an agile
methodology, in which development was performed in iterations and divided into three (3) sprints representing the main functionalities of the system. The design of the chatbot referenced the user needs according to the requirements analysis, incorporating appropriate HCI principles and accessibility features. The chatbot was developed through the use of the Botpress framework to implement rule-based and Natural Language Processing algorithms, such as Intent Classification, Slot Identification, and Entity Extraction. As part of the implementation plan, user acceptance testing was conducted with 25 DLSL-affiliated respondents. Results of the UAT concluded with a“STRONGLY AGREE” rating for the chatbot evaluation, “AGREE” rating on the positive user satisfaction evaluation, and “DISAGREE” rating on the negative user satisfaction evaluation. All software test cases for the chatbot systems were successfully passed. The study recommends the chatbot UAT to be expanded in respondent size, improve the system’s NLP capabilities, and extend accessibility features and data analytics through dashboard.

<h3><strong> Waste Management System of the Residents of Brgy. Mojon-Tampoy: An Analysis </strong></h3>

<p><strong>(2017-2018)</strong></p>

<h3> Abstract </h3>

>The thesis focuses the system of waste management of the residents of Brgy. Mojon-Tampoy and the practices they perform regarding the topic. As a case study, the research explores the in-depth aspects that define the issue of the barangay. In the theoretical part, the idea of Responsible Environmental Behavior is described. Previous studies are discussed and showed different findings on variables affecting waste management. The research used interviews and observations as ways of gathering information on waste management and practices. A total of ten households from Brgy. Mojon-Tampoy were interviewed. Data from the respondents are directly transcribed without alteration although some unclear parts were given an educated guess. The last part clarifies the implementation of environmental programmes and projects focusing on helping the residents on the waste issue. This thesis is not aimed at people who does not have permanent residence at the barangay for they don’t have a fixed effect at the waste management issue. This thesis is created in correspondence of what the researchers observed in the barangay that was needed to be addressed, which is aiming for the improvement and development of the waste management system of the residents of Brgy. Mojon-Tampoy.

<h3><strong> Perceptions of the SHS Community of De La Salle Lipa on the Level of Influence of CAPSTONE project, “Layered Decomposer”, to the Waste Management Attitudes of Brgy. Mojon-Tampoy Residents </strong></h3>

<p><strong>(2018-2019)</strong></p>

<h3> Abstract </h3>

>This study assessed the possible influences of the CAPSTONE project of S12-18, namely “CO2-N: Compost to Optimize through the Nexus Way”, and its innovation, the Layered Decomposer, towards the Waste Management Attitudes of Brgy. Mojon-Tampoy Residents. The data regarding the influences comes from the perceptions of teachers and students in the Senior High School Community of De La Salle Lipa who are deeply and directly related to the CAPSTONE Initiatives in the Senior High School Curriculum. The aspects of knowledge, satisfaction, and socioeconomic factors in relation to the product are assessed to find its relationship towards the residents’ attitudes. Demographic profiles of gender and the subjects taught and preferred are included for assessment. It employed a descriptive survey research using questionnaire-checklists as data gathering instruments. Respondents are 30 selected SHS community members, a mix of teachers and students, from the STEM, ABM, and HUMMS strands, comprising the population of the study. The researchers were the key informants in orienting the selected respondents regarding the background of the project, its purpose, use, and advantages for its utility. The study revealed correlation stats between the demographics of gender and subjects, the knowledge, satisfaction, and socioeconomical aspects of influence, and the attitudes of residents towards waste management. The study also revealed any significance among the variables presented. Finally, the conclusions presented has significant implications for the Layer Decomposer’s development. Recommendations to improve the project’s influence for increased positive community attitudes are suggested accordingly to the results.

<h3><strong> An Innovative Composting Optimization Through the Nexus Way: A Mixed-Method Approach </strong></h3>

<p><strong>(2018-2019)</strong></p>

<h3> Abstract </h3>

>This study evaluates the modernization of composting as a strategic technology for agricultural activities done in Brgy. Mojon-Tampoy, San Jose, Batangas by Project CO2N: Compost to Optimize through the Nexus Way; a project under the CAPSTONE Initiatives that features a product called the Layered Decomposer. By utilizing a mixed-method approach with a convergent parallel design, the overall success of the project was evaluated based on product quality and functionality, community impact and effectiveness, and user satisfaction. The descriptive statements provided through focus group discussions were coded and analyzed to reveal a positive feedback on all aspects of the project. The quantifiable statistics from administered survey questionnaires resulted in positive correlations in terms of all established criteria. Conclusively, the assessment garnered highly positive results suggesting that the project is overall successful.

<h3><strong>A quantitative study exploring DLSL college students’ overall online learning experience and their perceptions on different AI-applied learning services for quarantined education</strong></h3>

<p><strong>(2022)</strong></p>

<h3> Abstract </h3>

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a wide range of educational applications, such as personalized learning platforms to boost student learning and automated evaluation systems to aid teachers. Machine learning, algorithm creation, and natural language processing are all examples of AI. AI applications are reshaping educational resources.
In spite of the fact that AI has the ability to provide adequate opportunities for learners and educators, there is still the issue of choosing the appropriate AI-based solution for learning that is suitable to the needs of DLSL college students especially in this
quarantined education environment. By utilizing a quantitative approach, the overall online learning experience of DLSL college students, as well as their perceptions towards different provided AI-based education services are assessed. The quantifiable
statistics from administered online survey questionnaires were analyzed through the use of frequency distribution tables and Likert Scale measurements. Conclusively, the research garnered average satisfaction on current overall online learning experiences
and above average perceptions on provided AI-based education services, suggesting that education services using AI concepts could be applied to improve students’ online learning experiences.

<h3><strong> A Mixed-method Recommendation Study:
Wearable IoT based COVID-19 Device to Monitor
the Condition of Nonhospitalized and Remotely Quarantined Patients </strong></h3>

<p><strong>(2022)</strong></p>

<h3> Description </h3>

> This study is a recommendation paper towards addressing the evident lack of hospital and human health resources to fairly accommodate every COVID-19 patient in the Philippines. Due to lack of hospital accommodations, patients are forced to be remotely quarantined in their
homes, with no appropriate medical professional monitoring. There is also a likely delay in immediate emergency response for self-quarantined individuals due to lack of professional monitoring, leading to higher health risks.

>This study proposes the incorporation of a wearable IOT solution that would allow monitoring of patients, which can be implemented for individuals who are not hospitalized and being isolated in their homes. This aims to: (1) Maintain a sustainable healthcare environment among hospitals
through making home quarantine a more viable and supported option for medical professionals, (2) improve monitoring capabilities of health professionals towards
individuals undergoing remote quarantine within their private homes or spaces, and (3) provide accessibility for immediate healthcare response for emergency cases among self-quarantined individuals.
